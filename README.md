# Java-Audio-Wave-Spectrum-API
Create Wave Spectrum from any Audio File using this API , written in JavaFX

How this works ?

1) We convert the given audio if not to **.wav** using **Jave2** library
2) We get the **.wav amplitudes** in a beautiful smart way
3) Based on the given **width of the canvas we draw the wave**
4) On every change of width re-calculate the wave and redraw
5) Run the code and see the magic happen :)
6) Download [XR3Player](https://github.com/goxr3plus/XR3Player) and see more magic like this
